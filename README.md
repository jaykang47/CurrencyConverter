# CurrencyConverter
Mini currency converter project using currencylayer API (source: https://github.com/apilayer/currencylayer-API). 

As of 2019/12/14, the currency converter function takes in four parameters (source currency code, destination currency code, the amount, and a boolean if the source is from USD).

Note: The access key I'm using is a basic plan (free) so I had to tweak the functions to convert the currency using the live rates (instead of directly using their conversion function).
